# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Background
The development of distributed ledger technology (blockchain) and smart contracts creates opportunities for a major transformation in how financial assets are generated, traded, and exchanged. Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization allows fractional ownership of tangible assets or corporate equity into globally tradable digital units with greater transparency and efficiency than traditional channels.

Indonesia has vast mineral resources, including gold, but global capital access is often hampered by cross-border legal constraints, traditional listing costs, and low liquidity. KLX Digital offers a solution through tokenization of company ownership (equity token), enabling global investors to purchase shares of PT Kristalin Eka Lestari (PT KEL) via $KLX tokens, receive dividends, and participate in governance — all under a clear legal structure (Dubai entity for issuance + Indonesian operations).

## 1.2 Evolution of Real Asset Investment to Digital Assets
Investment has evolved through several stages:  
- Physical asset ownership →  
- Paper instruments (stocks, ETFs, bonds) →  
- Digital-native assets (cryptocurrency) →  
- RWA tokenization.

Tokenization combines the advantages of real assets (cash flow, intrinsic value) with those of digital assets (24/7 liquidity, fractional ownership, programmable finance). Institutions are increasingly exploring RWA for scalability and efficiency.

## 1.3 Problems in the Gold Mining & Investment Industry
- Limited access for retail investors to private mining shares.  
- Low liquidity and long exit processes.  
- Lack of transparency in reserves and financial reports.  
- High costs for traditional listing and underwriting.  
- Complex cross-border legal frameworks.

## 1.4 Solution: Tokenization of Mining Shares
KLX Digital conducts an Equity Token Offering (ETO/STO).  
The $KLX token represents claims to PT KEL’s shares through a legal SPV mechanism.  
Holders gain economic rights (dividends) and governance rights, with benefits including:  
- Global accessibility  
- Fractional ownership  
- Automated dividend distribution via smart contracts  
- On-chain audit and proof-of-backing.
