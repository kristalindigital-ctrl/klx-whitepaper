# 7. Technology Architecture

## 7.1 Blockchain Layer
- Ethereum mainnet (ERC-20, upgradeable to ERC-1400/3643).  
- Cross-chain plans: BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum.  

## 7.2 Smart Contracts
- KLX Token (digital equity).  
- Dividend contract.  
- Treasury & reserve contract.  
- DAO governance contract.

## 7.3 On-Chain Dividend Distribution
Profits → stablecoins → treasury → smart contract → payouts to holders. Fully transparent.

## 7.4 Proof of Reserve
Audits verified on-chain via oracles (Chainlink). Reports stored on IPFS/Arweave.

## 7.5 Governance (DAO)
- 1 KLX = 1 vote.  
- Quadratic voting to prevent whale dominance.  
- Proposals: dividend policy, treasury use, expansion, upgrades.
