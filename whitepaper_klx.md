Future Roadmap: Bringing Indonesian Companies to the Global Blockchain Market

1. Introduction

1.1 Background

The development of distributed ledger technology (blockchain) and smart contracts opens up the opportunity for a major transformation in how financial assets are generated, traded, and exchanged. Real World Assets (RWA) tokenization enables the fractionalization of ownership of tangible assets or corporate equity into globally tradable digital units, with greater transparency and cost efficiency than traditional channels.

Indonesia has vast mineral resource reserves, including gold, but global capital access to local mining companies is often hampered by cross-border legal constraints, traditional listing costs, and low liquidity. KLX Digital offers a solution: tokenization.company ownership(equity token) so global investors can buy shares of PT Kristalin Eka Lestari (PT KEL) through $KLX tokens, receive dividends, and participate in governance — while remaining protected by a clear legal structure (issuing entity in Dubai + operations in Indonesia).

1.2 Evolution of Real Asset Investment to Digital Asset

Investment transformation goes through several phases: full ownership of physical assets → paper instruments (stocks/ETFs/bonds) → digital-native assets (crypto) → RWA tokenization. Tokenization combines the advantages of real assets (cash flow, intrinsic value) with the advantages of digital assets (24/7 liquidity, fractional ownership, programmable finance). Large institutions are beginning to explore RWA due to its potential scalability and cost efficiency.

1.3 Problems in the Gold Mining & Investment Industry

Limited accessfor retail investors to private mining company shares.

Low liquidityon private mining equity and the length of the exit process.

Lack of transparencyin production data, reserves, and financial reports.

High costsfor traditional stock listing/underwriting/issuance.

The complexity of cross-jurisdictional lawwhen wanting to open capital from foreign investors.

1.4 Solution: Tokenization of Mining Company Shares

KLX Digital doesEquity Token Offering (ETO/STO)The $KLX token represents a claim to a portion of PT KEL's shares (through an SPV mechanism and legal agreement). $KLX holders receive economic rights (dividends) and certain governance rights. The model's advantages include global accessibility, fractional ownership, automated dividend distribution via smart contract, and on-chain audit and proof-of-backing mechanisms.

2. KLX Digital Project Overview

2.1 What is KLX?

KLX issecurity/equity tokenwhich represents the ownership claim of PT Kristalin Eka Lestari in the specified proportion (initial backing = 5% of PT KEL's book value is used as the basis for the initial assessment and structural guarantee for token issuance). This token is issued by KLX Digital FZ-LLC(Dubai), with a compliance framework that combines VARA regulations and Indonesian corporate practices.

2.2 KLX Business Model: Token = Digital Stock

Core model: KLX Digital (the issuer) holds shares or economic rights related to PT KEL through an SPV. The issuer then issues $KLX to investors according to allocation. In summary:

PT KEL → mining operations & profit generation.

SPV → holds shares/economic rights contracts that supply dividend rights.

KLX Digital FZ-LLC → token issuer, responsible for international compliance.

$KLX holders → token owners who receive certain economic benefits & governance rights.

Operational flows: due diligence & valuation → legal structuring (SPV, shareholder agreement, token purchase agreement) → minting $KLX → KYC/whitelist investors → listing & secondary market → dividend distribution via smart contract.

2.3 Token-Based Dividend Mechanism

Principle: The company's net profit allocated to shareholders will also be allocated to $KLX holders based on the percentage of ownership associated with the token. Operational mechanism:

Financial statements are audited by independent auditors.

Dividend distribution decisions are approved in accordance with corporate governance (GMS / board + on-chain voting if relevant).

Dividend funds are converted to stablecoins (USDT/USDC) for on-chain settlement.

The distribution smart contract pays out to whitelist addresses based on ownership snapshots.

The payout ratio policy (e.g. target 30–60%) and frequency (quarterly/annually) are set out in the issuance documents and disclosure to investors.

2.4 Why Choose PT Kristalin Eka Lestari?

PT KEL was selected due to its combination of clear legal permits, promising exploration results and reserves, compliant operational practices, and management's commitment to transparency. (Company technical details: IUP number, measured reserves, production capacity must be filled in the Legal & Financial Appendix—see Chapter 16).

2.5 Dubai's Position as a Legal Base

KLX Digital FZ-LLC in Dubai was selected for:

Leveraging a more mature digital asset regulatory framework (VARA/DIFC).

Providing access to Middle Eastern capital & international investors.

Facilitate a token issuance structure that meets international compliance standards (KYC/AML, investor accreditation, security token regulation).

The legal structure rests on agreements that ensure investors' rights are recognized on-chain and off-chain (notarized agreements, on-chain NFT certificates, escrow arrangements, SPV covenants).

3. Vision, Mission & Added Value

3.1 KLX Global Vision

To be the reference platform in Southeast Asia fortokenization of mining company equity, bringing global capital to Indonesian resource projects in a safe, transparent and regulated manner.

3.2 Short & Long Term Missions

Short Term (0–18 months):legal setup Dubai & SPV; smart contract auditing; TGE & initial listing; KYC/AML build; dividend pilot.  
Mid Term (18–36 months):scale other RWA listings; launch DeFi mechanisms for KLX; expand institutional partnerships.  
Long Term (3–7 years):becoming a standardized RWA marketplace, listing on regulated security token exchanges, and integrating CBDC-ready rails.

3.3 Differentiation of KLX with Other Tokenization Projects (PAXG, XAUT, DigixDAO)

Main difference: KLX isequity token(the right to company profits and potential capital gains from company growth), rather than bullion tokens that simply represent physical gold ownership. KLX offers dividends, governance rights, and a binding SPV legal structure—making it a security-like product with an active income stream.

3.4 Value Added: Dividends + Basic Assets + RWA Expansion

Real yield:periodic dividends.

Value growth:operational leverage of PT KEL (reserve discovery, production efficiency).

Fragmentation of ownership:investment access starting from small nominal amounts.

Model expansion:can be replicated to other mining assets & RWA sectors.

4. Market Analysis

4.1 Global Gold & Mining Market

Gold remains a safe-haven asset, with demand from investors, the jewelry industry, and central bank holdings. The gold mining sector requires high capital but offers potential margins if companies successfully optimize operational costs and increase output. Indonesia holds a strategic role due to its vast mineral reserves and exploration prospects.

(NOTE: include specific numerical data — annual production, national reserves, average gold price — in the Appendix; RWA market projection figures can be cited from BCG/ADDX/World Gold Council studies.)

4.2 Real Asset Tokenization Trends (RWA → USD 16 Trillion in 2030)

Industry reports indicate an acceleration in the tokenization of RWAs, including real estate, bonds, and commodities. Driving factors include the need for liquidity, lower distribution costs, retail investor demand for fractional ownership, and institutional adoption for settlement efficiency.

4.3 Competitor Analysis: Gold Tokenization vs Stock Tokenization

Gold tokenization (PAXG, XAUT):focused on bullion backing, offering price exposure to physical gold, generally without dividends.

Stock tokenization (KLX):exposure to company operations, dividend potential, governance rights.  
KLX advantages:operational cash flow (dividends), operational leverage, and potential appreciation if the company grows.

4.4 KLX's Position in the RWA Ecosystem

The KLX occupies a unique niche:equity RWAfrom an Indonesian-based mining company but issued through a pro-crypto jurisdiction (Dubai), facilitating access to international capital while remaining compliant with local laws for operational activities.

5. Basic Assets & Company Structure

5.1 Profile of PT Kristalin Eka Lestari (permits, reserves, operations)

PT Kristalin Eka Lestari (PT KEL) is a gold mining operating entity in Indonesia. Profile summary (fill in actual data in the Appendix):

Legal Status:[PLACEHOLDER — IUP / SK / other permit number]

Mine Location:[PLACEHOLDER — province/district]

Measured & Probable Reserves:[PLACEHOLDER — number of tons / grade gold g/t]

Annual Production Capacity:[PLACEHOLDER — ounces/tons per year]

Operational History & Environmental Management:summary of ESG, CSR, and AMDAL licensing practices.

Note: this section must be accompanied by supporting documents — geological reports, reserve & resource statements, feasibility studies, and environmental permits — which will be important attachments for investors and auditors.

5.2 Corporate Structure (PT KEL & KLX Digital FZ-LLC)

Legal structure:

PT KEL (Indonesia)— operational entities, IUP holders, exploration & production activity actors.

SPV (e.g. Kristalin Holdings Ltd. / an entity we form)— holding shares granted as a backing basis for token issuance (ring-fencing).

KLX Digital FZ-LLC (Dubai)— token issuer, responsible for $KLX issuance and compliance with VARA/DIFC.

The legal scheme guarantees that economic rights representing a portion of shares can be disbursed through dividend mechanisms and/or buyback claims according to the agreement.

5.3 Backing Mechanism: Company Stock Tokenization

Backing process:

Valuation & Book Value— independent auditors assess the book value of PT KEL; a percentage (e.g. 5%) is allocated as initial backing.

Share Transfer / Economic Rights Granting— SPV receives shares or economic rights from PT KEL through a legal agreement.

Issuance Agreement— KLX Digital issues $KLX tokens that represent units of ownership of economic rights in the SPV.

On-chain Certificate— legal documents (MoU, Shareholder Agreement) are stamped into verifiable NFTs on the blockchain as proof-of-backing.

Legal documents should include ring-fencing, escrow clauses, buy-back triggers, and dispute resolution mechanisms.

5.4 Independent Valuation & Audit

All base value and reserve claims must be verified by an independent auditor (a Big 4 or reputable geological engineering auditor). The audit includes a financial audit, a technical audit (JORC/NI 43-101 reporting style), and a proof-of-reserves check. The audit results are published (summary) on-chain via an NFT certificate and are fully documented in the Legal & Financial Appendix.

5.5 Dividend Distribution Mechanism

Source of funds:net profit allocated for dividends.

Decision:Dividend distribution is approved through a corporate governance mechanism (GMS/board), which is recorded in the minutes and on-chain proof.

Settlement:convert funds to stablecoin → transfer to distribution smart contract → payout to whitelist wallet.

Snapshot & Eligibility:A snapshot of token ownership is determined on a specific date to determine the eligible holder.

Tax & Compliance:Dividend taxes and other tax obligations are handled in accordance with Indonesian law and cross-border rules as per UAE/Dubai regulations. Tax details will be included in the investor prospectus.

6. Legal Structure & Regulations

6.1 Stock Tokenization Regulation in Dubai (FZ-LLC Framework)

KLX Digital FZ-LLC was founded in one ofFree Zone Dubaiwhich has a progressive legal framework for digital assets and fintech activities. Status
Free Zone Limited Liability Company (FZ-LLC)gives KLX Digital the freedom to:

Publishsecurity tokenas a representation of share ownership.

Carrying out activitiesdigital asset managementAndglobal fundraising.

Compileinternational legal agreementswhich is binding with the parent company (PT Kristalin Eka Lestari in Indonesia).

With this legal framework, KLX is not just a utility token, butvalid security tokenwhich is subject to the free zone rules. If there is synchronization withVirtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA)or other Dubai regulators, then the tokens will be regulated under a virtual asset license.

6.2 Legality of PT Kristalin Eka Lestari in Indonesia

As a parent,PT Kristalin Eka Lestari (PT KEL)has official permits in the gold mining sector in Indonesia, including:

Mining Business Permit (IUP)

Mining exploration & exploitation rights

Compliance with environmental, social and labor regulations

With this, the KLX token hasunderlying real company shares, not based solely on speculation.

6.3 Legal Relationships Between Entities

The legal structure of KLX is built on the basis of cross-border relations:

PT KEL (Indonesia)→ entity that owns physical assets (mines & gold).

KLX Digital FZ-LLC (Dubai Free Zone)→ KLX token issuing entity (security token issuer).

Global Investors→ token holders who have the same status as digital shareholders.

This relationship is bound byInternational MoU & digital share agreement, so that ownership of KLX tokens = proof of ownership of PT KEL shares.

6.4 KYC/AML Compliance for Global Investors

KLX implements proceduresKnow Your Customer (KYC)AndAnti-Money Laundering (AML)in accordance with international standards applicable in the Dubai Free Zone, including:

Identity verification (passport, ID card, legal documents).

Screening of international sanctions lists (OFAC, FATF).

Monitoring on-chain activity for money laundering detection.

This compliance is important so that the KLX token canlisting on a regulated exchangeand attract institutional investors.

6.5 Regulatory Risks & Mitigation Strategies

Like all tokenization projects, KLX faces cross-jurisdictional legal risks. Potential challenges:

Changes to security token rules in Dubai Free Zone.

Legal synchronization between digital token ownership and PT KEL shares.

Taxation and distribution of dividends across countries.

Prepared mitigation:

Free Zone Compliance→ ensure all activities comply with Free Zone Authority rules & where relevant with VARA.

Legal Wrapper→ use of international legal agreements to link tokens to PT KEL shares.

Audit & Disclosure→ mining operations & financial reports are published regularly.

Regulator Engagement→ proactive communication with Dubai Free Zone authorities and Indonesian regulators.

7.3 On-Chain Dividend Distribution

The process of distributing dividends to KLX holders is carried outprogrammed, transparent, and automatic:

PT KEL's financial reports were audited by an independent party.

The net profit allocated for dividends is locked into a smart contract.

Dividend funds are converted to stablecoins (USDT/USDC).

The smart contract distributes dividends to all wallet holders according to their ownership percentage.

Distribution formula:

Dividenwallet=TokenwalletTotalSupply×ProfitdistributionDividend_{wallet} = \frac{Token_{wallet}}{TotalSupply} \times Profit_{distribution}Dividendwallet​=TotalSupplyTokenwallet​​×Profitdistribution​

7.4 Proof of Reserve & Transparency

Independent auditcarried out periodically on the reserves and financial reports of PT KEL.

Chainlink Oracleused to connect off-chain data (audits, gold prices) to the blockchain.

Financial reports and audit documents are uploaded toIPFS/Arweavefor permanent & immutable evidence.

7.5 Governance & DAO

Decimal: 18

Main Chain: Ethereum (EVM) with cross-chain expansion plans (BSC, Polygon).

8.2 Token Distribution *

The distribution of KLX tokens is carried out with attention to the interests of public investors, the development team, the company treasury, and the sustainability of the ecosystem.

8.3 Vesting & Lock-up Schedule

To maintain price stability after listing, some token allocations will be locked according to the following schedule:

Team & Advisor→ 24 month lock, vested 12.5% ​​per quarter after the lock period ends.

Strategic Partnership→ 12 month lock, vested linearly over the next 12 months.

Treasury & Reserve→ locked with a multi-sig mechanism, can only be disbursed for buybacks & liquidity needs.

Staking & Reward Pool→ released gradually over 36 months according to ecosystem growth.

8.4 Dividend Mechanism (On-Chain / Off-Chain Payout)

KLX is a token thatdigital stock-based, so that token holders are entitled to receive dividends.

Mechanism:

Annual financial audit→ PT KEL's net profit is calculated.

Dividend allocation→ for example 40% of net profit.

Stablecoin conversion→ dividend funds are converted to USDT/USDC.

Smart contract payout→ automatic distribution to wallet holders.

💡 Example:

PT KEL's net profit = $50,000,000

Dividend allocation = 40% = $20,000,000

Circulating supply = 160,000,000 KLX

Holders of 1,000,000 KLX → receive$125,000directly to wallet.

8.5 Buyback & Burn Policy (Optional)

To increase the long-term value of the token:

Buyback: some of the profits are used to buy KLX from the market.

Burn: buyback tokens can be burned → supply decreases.

Deflationary effect: supply decreases, demand is stable/increasing → prices have the potential to increase.

8.6 Revenue Model KLX *

In addition to dividends from PT KEL's net profit, KLX will also receive revenue from:

Trading Volume Fee: small fees from KLX transactions on exchanges (CEX/DEX).

Staking Fee: operational costs of smart contract staking.

Chapter 11. Governance Model

11.1 KLX DAO Structure

To maintain transparency and engagement of the investor community, KLX uses a modelDecentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

KLX Digital FZ-LLC (Dubai)→ as a token issuer, remains the legal entity that connects real assets (PT KEL shares) with $KLX tokens.

PT Kristalin Eka Lestari (Indonesia)→ as an operational entity, provider of underlying assets and profit generator.

KLX DAO→ on-chain forum that governs global investor voting rights.

This DAO functions asadditional governance layers, where strategic decisions can be voted on by KLX holders in a transparent manner.

11.2 Token Holder Voting Rights

$KLX holders are entitled to two main types of rights:

Economic Rights→ receive dividends according to token ownership.

Voting Power→ determine the direction of company policy.

Voting mechanism:

1 KLX = 1 vote(with quadratic voting option for fairness).

Long-term stakers can earnbonus voting power.

All voting results are stored on-chain and are publicly verifiable.

11.3 Proposal & Voting Mechanism

Every major decision in the KLX ecosystem can be submitted asgovernance proposal.

Proposal Type:

Corporate Action: acquisition, investment in new assets, mine expansion.

Dividend Policy: percentage of net profit distributed.

Treasury Usage: buyback & burn, staking rewards, reserve funds.

Technological Upgrade: smart contract upgrade, cross-chain integration.

Partnership Agreement: strategic collaboration with other exchanges, institutions, or RWA projects.

Voting Flow:

Proposals are submitted to the DAO smart contract.

Discussion period (off-chain forum + on-chain signaling).

Voting lasts 7 days.

Minimum quorum 20%of the total circulating supply.

Proposals with a majority vote are automatically executed by the governance smart contract.

11.4 Community-Driven Expansion

The KLX global community is not only a passive investor, but also aactive role holder in project expansion.

Community Proposals→ holders can submit strategic proposals (for example, listing on a particular exchange, or an educational program).

Airdrop & Reward Program→ community participation is incentivized with reward tokens.

Ambassador Program→ KLX opens opportunities for regional representatives to expand the ecosystem.

With this approach, KLX DAO ensures every major decision of the companynot only determined by management, but also bytoken holders collectively.

Chapter 12. Risk & Mitigation

12.1 Commodity Price Risk (Gold/Nickel)

Risk:  The prices of gold and other mining commodities are volatile, influenced by global factors (interest rate policy, inflation, and geopolitics). If prices fall significantly, PT KEL's profits could decrease, resulting in a corresponding decrease in dividends.

Mitigation:

Asset diversification: in addition to gold, plans to expand intonickel, coal and renewable energy.

Hedging: companies can use derivative contracts (futures, options) to protect against price volatility.

Reserve policy: part of the earnings is retained asbuffer reserveto maintain dividend stability.

12.2 Regulatory Risks (Security Token Law)

Risk:  The KLX token is a security token and is subject to securities laws. There is a risk of regulatory changes in both Dubai (FZ-LLC/VARA) and Indonesia. Regulatory changes could impact the legality of listings, dividend distributions, or cross-border transfers.

Mitigation:

Legal structuredual entity(PT KEL in Indonesia, KLX Digital FZ-LLC in Dubai) → flexibility to face regulatory changes.

Ongoing legal consultation withinternational law firm.
